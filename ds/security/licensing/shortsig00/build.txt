The code should work when compiled normally with the build system,
but the original winlogon.exe uses a precompiled shortsig00.lib,
so if you want to get the same binary code as in the original,
you'll need to disable the optimizations and get the compiler from VC6SP5
(because of disabled optimizations the exact version isn't that important,
but the one from the build system insists on aligning stack variables
with size >= 64 bytes on 8-byte boundary, it will give a few diffs).
